This part of the Upper Upper East Side is a place for families, young, old, black, white, Latino, rich, poor--it just depends what block you stumble upon.

Get some culture at the neighborhoods museums, get some knowledge at a lecture at the 92nd Street Y, but most importantly, get ready to be somewhere where people can actually live, work, and shop. Nothing hip or cool here, this is just a good old-fashioned New York neighborhood. Much of this part of the Upper East Side is known as Carnegie Hill, named for the Carnegie Mansion on 91st and Fifth Avenue (it's now the Cooper-Hewitt Design Museum). --- THE NEIGHBORHOOD: The ""Museum Mile"" is just 3 blocks away on Fifth Avenue, next to Central Park, a mere 5-7 mi",". **** NO SMOKERS, DRUNKS OR DRUG ADDICTS.

The vibrant culture, friendly neighbors, and historical landmarks in the neighborhood is a crucial part of New York City's multicultural fabric that makes the city great. If you're familiar with the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, you'll enjoy the fact that you'll be in walking distance to the famous Apollo Theatre and Savoy Ballroom.  We are also located next to Columbia University, one of the most prestigious universities in the country. There is a bus that brings you to the steps of Morningside Park which is the park that separates the school from the rest of the city. Obviously, safety is one of the main concerns for newcomers to New York. To those that come from suburbia, it is common for there to be many loiterers, especially during the summer months. Being part of the community this long, I can attest that it is as safe as the rest of Manhattan. It is important to remember that no matter where y","Please do not lose the key cards to the building. Replacing it is expensive! I'll have to charge $50 for each missing key card. On days when there will be a guest checking in after you, I ask the guest that is leaving to do check out by 10 am so the house cleaner has adequate time to thoroughly clean for the next guest. I also ask the next guest to check in no earlier than 2 pm. On days when there is no overlap of guests, we are completely flexible about check-in or check-out times.","Most transportation methods get you to the apartment easily. We're conveniently located a few blocks from the 4/5/6 line, 2/3 line, and Metro North. There is also an express bus to and from La Guardia Airport. A few minutes from our doorstep are some of Harlem's favorite eateries: Red Rooster, Chez Lucienne, Barawine, and 125th St shopping (Marshall's, Old Navy, and a plethora of others). There's a gym located two blocks away and they have day passes if you're looking to work out during your stay. Otherwise, you can run along the East River along the esplanade which is a few blocks east of the building. The best form of travel around here is your feet! You are probably in some of the world's most walkable cities (unless bad weather). Many enthusiasts walk down to Central Park and spend the day biking around the most famous park in our city. Citi Bikes can be a fun way to explore the city as well, again if the weather is okay. It is easy to set up and I can help you with that.

Since the 1920s, Harlem has been known as a major African American residential, cultural and business center. Originally a Dutch village, formally organized in 1658, it is named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands.  The famous Apollo Theater opened on 125th Street on January 26, 1934, in a former burlesque house. The Savoy Ballroom, on Lenox Avenue, was a renowned venue for swing dancing, and was immortalized in a popular song of the era, ""Stompin' At The Savoy"".
